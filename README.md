Beer on Rails
=============

I collect stickers from beer bottles from all over the world, and I've got a lot of them. And I mean a _lot_ - at the time of this writing well over 500 catalogued, and some 300-400 not yet catalogued.

This project is an interactive online catalogue for all those, written with Ruby and Rails. It stores the names, breweries and photos - amongst other things - for each separate beers, and provides many sorting and filtering functions.

It will be deployed to a webserver once finished.
